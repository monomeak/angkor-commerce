/**
 * Domain types for invoices, mapped from core-api's InvoiceResponse / InvoiceSummaryResponse.
 *
 * Two things worth knowing before reading these:
 *
 * 1. An invoice is only ever created by a confirmed payment (`CheckoutServiceImpl`) — the back
 *    office has no create endpoint. So this feature is read-and-print, not an invoice editor.
 * 2. The API has no "overdue" status. It stores ISSUED → PARTIALLY_PAID → PAID (or CANCELLED);
 *    overdue is derived at render time from dueDate and balance — see lib/invoice-display.ts.
